## The concept behind the technology: 

- VCS Integration
CircleCI integrates with GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, and Bitbucket. Every time you commit code, CircleCI creates a build.
- Automated Testing
CircleCI automatically runs your build in a clean container or virtual machine, allowing you to test every commit.
- Notifications
Your team is notified if a build fails so issues can be fixed quickly.
-Automated Deployment
Passing builds are deployed to various environments so your product goes to market faster.
